  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # when specific activity happens, scheduled time, or when an event out side of github occures

# Environment variables
# These variables defined inside env at the top level of the workflow file are scoped for the entire workflow. Any step inside any job can access the value of these variables
# best way to use the env variables is between ${{}} ${{env.testvar}}

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# Job is a set of steps in a workflow that executes on the same runner. Each step is either a script that will be executed or an action that will run

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-app:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # these variables declared inside env of this job are scoped to be used within this job. Outside of this job, we will not be able to access these variables
    # best way to use the env variables is between ${{}} ${{env.testvar}}

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. We can transfer data between steps because each one is carried out on the same runner machine
    # For instance, you can have a step that builds your application followed by a step that tests the application that was built in the previous step right.
